# NUMBER-GAME
The task is to write a Java program in which a user will get K trials to guess a randomly generated number. Below are the rules of the game:

. If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.
. If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.
. If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the K trials are exhausted, the program will end with a suitable message.

# Approach: Below are the steps:

. The approach is to generate a random number using Math.random() method in Java.
. Now using a loop, take K input from the user and for each input print whether the number is smaller or larger than the actual number.
. If within K trials the user guessed the number correctly, print that the user won.
. Else print that he was not able to guess and then print the actual number.
